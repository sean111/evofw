Code 215: evofw
===============

# About
I created this framework when I started coding lcnlegacy.com to help me speed up development time.

# Using evofw
Coming Soon

# License
I am currently looking into which OS license I should put this under. Currently it's free to use as long as you don't sell the code.

# Helping
No one is perfect and I am definitally far from it. If you see something you would like to fix please fork the code and send me a pull request.
